# Buul
Computer Version of Bul, also called Buul, Boolik or Puluc, is a running-fight board game originating in Mesoamerica, and is known particularly among several of the Maya peoples of the Guatemalan highlands. It is uncertain whether this specific game dates back to the pre-Columbian Maya civilization, or whether instead it developed in the post-colonial era after the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores.
